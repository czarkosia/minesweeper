The purpose of this project is to recreate the popular computer game called minesweeper. After running main.py file a random minefield is generated, with the number of mines adjacent to every safe square. Opening cells by the left mouse click includes chording. Right click is used to mark any cell with a flag. Game is finished after revealing all the safe squares. This work is still in progress and some other features will be added soon.
